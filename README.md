# Hangman-Game-Project-Using-Java
I have Created 1 Group project with my friends in MCA semester 1 for our Object Oriented Programming in Java Subject.

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Java. The game involves a player attempting to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project is designed to showcase Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, arrays, and user interaction through the console.

Features:
- A predefined list of words or dynamic word selection.
- A system to track correct and incorrect guesses.
- A display of the word with unguessed letters hidden as underscores (`_`).
- A limited number of attempts before the player loses.
- A win/loss detection system.
- User-friendly prompts and messages to enhance gameplay.

 Technologies Used:
- Java Core (JDK): Used for logic implementation.
- Scanner Class: To take user input.
- Arrays & Strings: For handling the word and guessed letters.
- Loops & Conditional Statements: To control the game flow.
